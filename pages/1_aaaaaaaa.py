# The Present, The Past & The Future of Bitcoin. 
## A simulation of the economics and usability of Bitcoin as it is, as it was and as it will be.


This is meant as a tool for anyone who wants to simulate the economic & end user reality of Bitcoin(s) with an (somewhat) rigorous analysis of the most important aspects of Bitcoin. 

### How to use this tool

#### Settings & Options Sidebar
- On first open of this tool you should be reading this text as well as a visible sidebar menu on the left hand of your screen with various sliders and options.
- If this sidebar is missing, please press the button at the uppermost top left that should look like ">". 
    - On mobile this menu is collapsed on start due to space constraints.
- Any changes made to the settings in the sidebar menu will immediately take effect on both the numbers and charts throughout the presentation.
- The sidebar has more than a full screen worth of options, please make sure to scroll fully down to validate you have seen all availiable settings.
- It is suggested before adjusting any options, to go on to each section carefully and read the information and perform any of the "Suggested Excercises"
- To reset all options to defaults, please refresh the page. All default options are set to the actual current numbers of each network, August 2023.

#### Charts
- Charts can be clicked on to full screen them, mouse wheel to zoom in/out. You can also hover over each line/point to see more detailed information. They can also be exported to various formats.
- Additionally the data used to derive the charts should be availiable in the tab next to each chart, as well as the formula used to derive the datasets.
- The entirety of the source code used to generate this page is also available.

    Some suggested exercises:
    - Change the "Block Reward" amount as well as the "Prices in USD" for each :orange[BTC] & :green[BCH] to see how the chart interacts.
    - Adjust the "Hashrate" of :green[BCH], notice how it affects the :green[BCH] chart.
    - Adjust the "Hashrate" of :orange[BTC]. Notice how the :orange[BTC] chart stays the same, "Hashrate" â‰  Energy Usage.
        - On the other hand, notice how strangely it affects the :green[BCH] chart instead of the :orange[BTC] chart. This is because the power usage for :green[BCH] is derived from the efficiency ratio of the orange:[BTC] network.
        - The power usage for :orange[BTC] is found from here: https://ccaf.io/cbnsi/cbeci and the hashrate for :orange[BTC] & :green[BCH] are found here: https://www.fork.lol/pow/hashrate
        - We use the hashrate to power usage ratio from :orange[BTC] and use it to derive :green[BCH] power usage based on :green[BCH] current hashrate.
        - This assumes each network has equivalent efficiency in terms of the mining machines used.
    - Adjust the "Energy Usage in TwH" :orange[BTC]. Again, this affects both :orange[BTC] & :green[BCH] charts. :red[Remember], :green[BCH] electric efficiencies are derived from :orange[BTC], but scaled for its own hashrate.
        - Raising "Energy Usage in TwH" for :orange[BTC] while keeping the "Hashrate" the same, or lowering it simulates LESS efficient mining machines on both :orange[BTC] & :green[BCH] networks.
        - Lowering "Energy Usage in TwH" for :orange[BTC] while keeping the "Hashrate" the same, or increasing it simulates MORE efficient mining machines on both :orange[BTC] & :green[BCH] networks.

Now some interesting things start to emerge... once the price per KwH gets close the the cheapest availiable KwH we see that:

    - @ 25 Bitcoins (BTC) *the block reward* **was enough to cover the energy costs up to about .235/Kwh.**

Ok, so lets look into the far future.
All of this has been based on the current fact regarding the cost of electricity.

If we ever manage to figure out superconductors and fusion, the price of electricity is going to go towards zero.

So in effect at this point, the price of electricity doesn't matter. This will cause several interesting things. Lets explore this.
Additionally there are definitely miners who already produce and use electricity for free.

Additionally the block reward ever increasingly moves towards zero as well. This will be an interesting thing as well.
